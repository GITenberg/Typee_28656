description: Melville's first novel was based on his experiences in French Polynesia.
  Tommo and Toby, tired of an abusive life on the whaling ship, decide to hide on
  an island. They soon discover the Typees, who bring them into their village with
  kindness, despite being cannibals. Contrasting the idyllic life of the natives with
  the corrupting influence of civilization, Typee gives early evidence of Melville's
  genius.
